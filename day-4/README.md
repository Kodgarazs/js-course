# Lesson 4 - HTML

## Tools
It is easy to use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) for editor instead of using any desktop application. It is easy to register with a github account.

## Create a simple HTML page
Covered elements:
- `<!doctype>`
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`
- `<p>`
- `<img>` (only with images hosted by other sites, using "copy imag url" feature in Chrome)

Additional things:
- embeding a youtube video
- `style="color: red"`
